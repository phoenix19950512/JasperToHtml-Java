/**
 * The Candlestick plot is also an axis-oriented plot and allows you to customize axis labels 
 * using expressions. It can be used only in combination with a Candlestick chart.
 * <br/>
 * The Candlestick chart uses a High-Low dataset, but unlike the High-Low chart, the 
 * Candlestick chart can make use of the volume value inside each dataset item.
 * <br/>
 * The volume value is displayed as the body of the candlestick figure rendered for each 
 * item. The volume is displayed by default in a Candlestick chart but can be suppressed by 
 * setting the <code>isShowVolume</code> flag to false.
