/**
 * Chart themes give more control over chart output, including 
 * the creation of the JFreeChart object itself. Also, chart themes 
 * affect a whole range of chart types across multiple reports and are not necessarily tied to 
 * a specific chart element within a report. They can even apply globally to all charts within 
 * a given JasperReports deployment, applying a new look and feel to all charts created.
 * <br/>
 * A chart theme can be set globally using a configuration property within the 
 * <code>jasperreports.properties</code> file as follows: 
 * <br/><br/>
 * <code>net.sf.jasperreports.chart.theme=&lt;theme_name&gt;</code> 
 * <br/><br/>
 * The global chart theme can be overridden at report level using the following report 
 * property in the report template: 
 * <br/><br/>
 * <code>&lt;property name="net.sf.jasperreports.chart.theme" value="&lt;theme_name&gt;"/&gt;</code> 
 * <br/><br/>
 * If needed, at chart element level, the chart theme is specified using the <code>theme</code> attribute.
