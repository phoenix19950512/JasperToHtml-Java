/**
 * An exporter filter that excludes elements based on their keys.
 *
 * The filter uses a fixed set of elements keys to exclude.
 * <p/>
 * Element keys are set at report design time and are propagated into generated reports.
 * Each element in a filled report has the same key as the element from the report template
 * that generated it.
 * <p/>
 * To trigger an element key filter, the report designer needs to define one or more report
 * properties that start with <code>&lt;exporter_property_prefix&gt;.exclude.key</code>. Each such
 * property matches a single element key which is to be excluded by the filter. The element
 * key is given by the property value, or if no value is set for the property, by the property
 * suffix.
 * <p/>
 * The following example shows how to specify element keys which are to be excluded
 * from specific export outputs:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;jasperReport ...&gt;
 *   &lt;!-- exclude elements with keys Image1 and Text4 from HTML export --&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="net.sf.jasperreports.export.html.exclude.key.Image1"/&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="net.sf.jasperreports.export.html.exclude.key.Text4"/&gt;
 *   &lt;!-- exclude elements with keys Image5 from PDF export --&gt;
 *   &lt;property name="net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.exclude.key.the.image" value="Image5"/&gt;
 *   ...
 * &lt;/jasperReport&gt;
 * </pre>
