/**
 * An abstract representation of a break element.
 * <p/>
 * The break element was added to the list of elements that can be placed inside a
 * band. This is used for introducing a page break or column break at a specified position
 * within the band.
 * <p/>
 * In many ways, the break element behaves like any other normal element placed in a band.
 * For instance, it can be conditionally displayed using <code>&lt;printWhenExpression&gt;</code>, 
 * and it can float within the band if <code>positionType="Float"</code> is used. Other common element
 * properties like colors and styles do not make any sense for this kind of element, because it
 * behaves like an invisible horizontal line that crosses the whole parent band and indicates the
 * <code>y</code> position where a page break or column break should occur when the band content is
 * rendered during the report-filling process.
 * <p/>
 * Whether a page break or a column break should be introduced is specified using the <code>type</code>
 * attribute available for this element (see {@link #getTypeValue()}). By default, page breaks are created.
