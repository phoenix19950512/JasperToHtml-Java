/**
 * Exception raised when an ICC profile is not available to the JVM. 
 * <p/>
 * The ICC profiles are defined by the International Color Consortium. They are a means by which OpenPDF ensures color
 * management in a device-independent manner and they need to be embedded for PDF/A-1 compliance.
 * <p/>
 * Here are some sources of freely available and high quality ICC profiles:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>sRGB ICC profiles provided by the International Color Consortium:
 *		<ul> 
 *			<li><a href="http://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.html">http://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.html</a></li>
 *		</ul>
 *	</li>
 * </li>
 * <li>RGB and CMYK ICC profiles for various printing conditions provided by the European Color Initiative (ECI):
 *		<ul>
 * 			<li><a href="http://www.eci.org/doku.php?id=en:downloads#icc_profiles_from_eci">http://www.eci.org/doku.php?id=en:downloads#icc_profiles_from_eci</a></li>
 * 		</ul>

 * <li>RGB and CMYK ICC profiles provided by Adobe:

 * <li>ICC profiles for standardised newspaper printing:
