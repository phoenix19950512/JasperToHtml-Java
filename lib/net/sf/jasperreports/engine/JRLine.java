/**
 * An abstract representation of a graphic element representing a straight line.
 * <p/>
 * When displaying a line element, JasperReports draws one of the two diagonals of the
 * rectangle represented by the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, and 
 * <code>height</code> attributes specified for this element.
 * <p/>
 * The <code>direction</code> attribute (see {@link #getDirectionValue()}) determines which 
 * one of the two diagonals of the rectangle  should be drawn:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>TopDown</code> - draws a diagonal line from the top-left corner of the
 * rectangle to the bottom-right corner.</li>
 * <li><code>BottomUp</code> - draws a diagonal line from the bottom-left corner to the
 * upper-right corner.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The default direction for a line is top-down.
 * <p/>
 * One can draw vertical lines by specifying <code>width="1"</code> and horizontal lines by setting
 * <code>height="1"</code>. For vertical lines, the direction is not important.
