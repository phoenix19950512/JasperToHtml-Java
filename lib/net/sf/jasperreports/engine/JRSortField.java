/**
 * Provides support for in-memory field-based data source sorting.
 * <p/>
 * JasperReports supports in-memory field-based data source sorting. This functionality can
 * be used, for instance, when data sorting is required and the data source implementation
 * does not support it (as in the case of the CSV data source).
 * <p/>
 * The sorting is activated by the presence of one or more <code>&lt;sortField&gt;</code> elements in the
 * report template. When at least one sort field is specified for the report, the original report
 * data source (either passed directly or provided by a query executer) is passed to a sorted 
 * {@link net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.IndexedDataSource} instance that fetches all the records 
 * from it, performs an in-memory
 * sort according to the specified fields, and replaces the original data source in the
 * report-filling process.
 * <p/>
 * The sort field name should coincide with a report field name. Fields used for sorting
 * should have types that implement <code>java.util.Comparable</code>. Sorting will be performed
 * using the natural order for all fields except those of type <code>java.lang.String</code>, for which
 * a collator corresponding to the report fill locale is used.
 * <p/>
 * When several sort fields are specified, the sorting will be performed using the fields as
 * sort keys in the order in which they appear in the report template.
