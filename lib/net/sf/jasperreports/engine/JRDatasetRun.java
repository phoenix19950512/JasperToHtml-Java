/**
 * Interface of an sub dataset instantiation.
 * <p/>
 * Once a dataset is declared inside a report template, it can be used only if it's actually
 * referenced by a chart, crosstab or other component. Simply declaring a dataset at the report 
 * level does not have any effect.
 * <p/>
 * When a dataset is referenced by a report component, a <i>dataset run</i> is instantiated. The
 * dataset runs through the supplied data source performing all the variable calculations and
 * the required data grouping.
 * <p/>
 * A dataset run declaration supplies the values for the dataset parameters as well as the
 * data source through which the dataset will iterate. Optionally, a <code>java.sql.Connection</code>
 * can be passed to the dataset instead of a {@link net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JRDataSource} instance, 
 * when there is a SQL query associated with the dataset. This query is executed by the engine using the
 * JDBC connection and the <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code> object obtained is iterated through.
 * <p/>
 * Dataset runs resemble subreports in the way parameters and the data source/connection
 * are passed in.
 * <p/>
 * Charts, crosstabs and other report components can reference datasets by instantiating and configuring dataset
 * runs. If no dataset run is specified for a component, the main dataset of the report is
 * used.
