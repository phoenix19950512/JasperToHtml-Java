/**
 * An abstract representation of a report static text. It provides functionality for static texts.
 * <p/>
 * Static texts are text elements with fixed content, which does not change during the
 * report-filling process. They are used mostly to introduce static text labels into the
 * generated documents.
 * <p/>
 * Besides the general element properties and the common text-specific properties, a static text 
 * definition has only the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> tag, which introduces the fixed text content 
 * of the static text element. The text content can be collected using the {@link #getText()} method.
