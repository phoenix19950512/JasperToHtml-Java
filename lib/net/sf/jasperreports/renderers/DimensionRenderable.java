/**
 * This interface is implemented by renderable objects that want to provide a dimension for the graphics they render,
 * usually by also implementing the {@link Graphics2DRenderable} interface.
 * Data renderables such as images or SVG files do not need to provide a dimension as that will be read from the files themselves when needed.
 * Reading the dimension of images and SVG documents is performed using wrapping rendeable implementations that wrap the original data renderable and only ask them for their data.
